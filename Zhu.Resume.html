				<p>
					Some of my favorite things to do is playing volleyball and watching sports. 
					I have played for a few years now but I have only played competitive for 3 years. 
					This year I am playing on the East Bay Volleyball Academy U16 team. 
					I am the captain of the team and is the starting outside hitter. 
					Dublin HS will also possibly have mens volleyball this year as well, so I am very
					excited for the high school season and the opportunity to represent DHS in my sport.
					I understand that there will be many difficulties getting started in the first season,
					but I hope that we will be able to overcome this challenges and become a successful team.
