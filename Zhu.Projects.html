				<h3>Memoryze - Entrepreneurship Project 2017</h3>
				<h4>May 2017</h4>
				<h4>Principles of Engineering</h4>
				<p> 
				For my 2017 Entrepreneurship Project, I worked on a four-man team with Dhiraj K, Matthew A, and Derek Z.
				We created an Android mobile application called Memoryze that helps students memorize blocks of text.
				The development cycle for this project lasted from May 5 to May 22. 
				During this project period, we developed and tested the app using Android Studio, documented our progress 
				on a Google doc, and finally presented the project to our POE class on May 24.
				Memoryze provides a structuralized process for memorization to help the user quickly remember a passage.
				On the start page, the user is asked to input a selected passage that they would like to memorize. 
				The app then displays the passage and asks the user to say the passage into the microphone. 
				After recording, the app runs a similarity check of the user recording and the original passage.
				This process of recording and similarity checking is repeated four times, and each time the app will cut 
				off some of the words to force the user to remember those words in association to the words around them.
				On the final repeat, all of the words are blanked out as the user records his/her voice, and getting a high
				similarity score will prove that they have sufficiently memorized the text. In the future, we would also like to
				add a camera function to the start page so that the user can simply take a picture of the text to quickly input 
				it rather than having to type it in manually.

				<h3>Solar/Hydrogen Vehicle</h3>
				<h4>Novermber 2016</h4>
				<h4>Principles of Engineering</h4>
				<p>Our team created a vehicle that could use both solar power and hydrogen power to run. 
				I worked with Mickie Enad, Sean Tseng, and Nick Talim on this project. 
				We brainstormed, designed, built, and documented the car together, and we were able to 
				use it to successfully test the various power configurations. I was the project leader, 
				so I was in charge of delegating jobs to the team and assisting them where ever I could. 
				Our final design was a four wheel base, two wheel drive vehicle with a roof on top. We used another plate
				to hold the power sources, and then attached that plate to the roof when we were finished. This allowed 
				us to change power sources easier and be able to fix the vehicle while someone else set up the power.
				Although we had some trouble picking designs for the car at first, we were eventually able to settle 
				on one design and finish on time. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1xXuAqltYIQBKoXfv6joUFafGSCiyjTI-4Ih3kL3p8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

				<h3>Paint Pot MIT AppInventor Project</h3>
				<h4>December 2015 - January 2016</h4>
				<h4>Computer Science and Engineering</h4>
				<p>This is the project log for an app I made with John So and Sean Tseng in my Computer Science Class. 
				Our app was called Paint Pot and it was a drawing app that we made using MIT AppInventor. 
				AppInventor uses blocks of pre-built code that you can put together like a puzzle to make your code. 
				It is very similar to the Scratch UI that I used to make the Tank Game Project. 
				I had to use many skills when creating this app, and two of the most important ones were communication and analyzing code. 
				When I had new ideas or something I wanted to say, I had to effectively communicate these ideas to my team so that they can clearly understand my idea and what it will incorporate. 
				We also had previous code that was already set up for us in the project, so we needed to analyze and understand the code in order to know how the app works. 
				Sometimes during the creation of the app, there were many difficulties that we could not forsee. 
				However, by working together, understanding, and manipulating the code, we were able to overcome these difficulties. 
				An example of this is our drawing function. Orginally, it drew very crooked and choppy lines. 
				We changed the code to make it draw lines of dots instead, and that actually appeared to fix our problem. 
				However, we found out that if you drew fast enough, the dotted lines would also be very choppy and inconsistent. 
				We were stumped. John would sometimes look at the screen with his hands in his hair and his teeth clenched together like a clamp. 
				Suddenly, an idea came to me in my head. What if we could draw the choppy lines and the dots at the same time?
				Although it was a seemingly stupid idea, I blurted it out and we tried out the idea. It actually worked!
				The dots covered up for the choppy parts of the line and the line connected the dots together to form a very smooth, clear-looking line. 
				In our app you can draw lines and dots, change backgrounds, change brush sizes, and change colors based on a RGB Hex color slider.
				There are three sliders that represent the colors red, green, and blue; and each slider is set from 0-255. 
				The app runs very smoothly and it can be used for fun with friends, family, and young children.

				<h3>Tank2</h3>
				<h4>September 2015</h4>
				<h4>Computer Science and Engineering</h4>
				<p>This is a game that I made with Noah B. 
				In this game you are a tank with suicide jeeps coming after you. 
				The goal is to stay alive for as long as possible. 
				You have two weapons, a flame thrower and a turret. 
				The turret has unlimited ammo but there is a reload time after each shot. 
				The flame thrower has a limited amount of fuel. 
				Some jeeps also have turrets so you should shoot them first. 
				This is my first project in my Computer Science class and I hope you like it.</p>
