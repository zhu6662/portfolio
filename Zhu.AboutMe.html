					Hi my name is Michael Zhu. 
					I am a sophomore at Dublin High School in Dublin, CA. 
					I am 15 years old and I was born in Walnut Creek. 
					I have lived in Dublin for all my life and I have been in their school system for all my life. 
					Right now I am in the Computer Science class at Dublin High. 
					When I grow up I want to major in engineering or business and live in LA or San Diego. 
					Right now at Dublin High I am in Robotics Club and DECA Club, and for my extracurricular I play volleyball.

					Some of my favorite things to do is playing volleyball and watching sports. 
					I have played for a few years now but I have only played competitive for 3 years. 
					This year I am playing on the East Bay Volleyball Academy U16 team. 
					I am the captain of the team and is the starting outside hitter. 
					Dublin HS will also possibly have mens volleyball this year as well, so I am very
					excited for the high school season and the opportunity to represent DHS in my sport.
					I understand that there will be many difficulties getting started in the first season,
					but I hope that we will be able to overcome this challenges and become a successful team.
